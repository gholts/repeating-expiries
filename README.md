# Repeating Expiries ![image](https://travis-ci.org/gholts/repeating-expiries.svg?branch=master)

Do you have events or calendar items that repeat, and you want to keep
track of them in a way that doesn't require a calendar or an app (besides a web browser)?
Well then this will be just the thing!

## What does it do?

* Log in with your Google account
* Add items and set intervals on which they expire
  * e.g. Clean the bathroom - expires every two weeks
* As the "due date" approaches, the item will get closer to fully red or "due"
* Once you've done the event, mark it down and the counter will reset to another two week interval (in this example)

## Sounds sweet, where do I go to use it?

At this moment, the app is just a figment of my imagination. But keep an eye on
this page for more info as it develops.
